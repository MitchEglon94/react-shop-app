React Shop App

Built using Redux Toolkit with React to practise state management in RTK.

The app currently pulls random shop items from 'https://fakestoreapi.com/' to replicate a store front.
These items are displayed on the storefront, with the ability to add an item to the basket.
In the basket, you have the option to increase/decrease the quantity of each item, which will reflect in the individual item price and the total basket price.

Additionally the options to remove individuals items, or clear the whole basket are also present.

Going forward, I will aim to convert this to a full stack MERN application.
